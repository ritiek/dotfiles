"""Routing helpers for inbound user-attached images.

Two modes:

  native  — attach images as OpenAI-style ``image_url`` content parts on the
            user turn. Provider adapters (Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Codex,
            OpenAI chat.completions) already translate these into their
            vendor-specific multimodal formats.

  text    — run ``vision_analyze`` on each image up-front and prepend the
            description to the user's text. The model never sees the pixels;
            it only sees a lossy text summary. This is the pre-existing
            behaviour and still the right choice for non-vision models.

The decision is made once per message turn by :func:`decide_image_input_mode`.
It reads ``agent.image_input_mode`` from config.yaml (``auto`` | ``native``
| ``text``, default ``auto``) and the active model's capability metadata.

In ``auto`` mode:
  - If the user has explicitly configured ``auxiliary.vision.provider``
    (i.e. not ``auto`` and not empty), we assume they want the text pipeline
    regardless of the main model — they've opted in to a specific vision
    backend for a reason (cost, quality, local-only, etc.).
  - Otherwise, if the active model reports ``supports_vision=True`` in its
    models.dev metadata, we attach natively.
  - Otherwise (non-vision model, no explicit override), we fall back to text.

This keeps ``vision_analyze`` surfaced as a tool in every session — skills
and agent flows that chain it (browser screenshots, deeper inspection of
URL-referenced images, style-gating loops) keep working. The routing only
affects *how user-attached images on the current turn* are presented to the
main model.
